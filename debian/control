Description: library for reading and writing JSON for C++
 jsoncpp is an implementation of a JSON reader and writer in C++. JSON
 (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format
 that it is easy to parse and redable for human. It is useful for
 building config files, network communications protocols, etc.
